        <h2>Meet Our Team</h2>
        <p> We are a team of 6 students who created Bharat Safari, a website dedicated to promoting tourism in India. We are passionate about our country and its rich culture and heritage, and we believe that tourism is a powerful tool for promoting understanding and appreciation of India. We created Bharat Yatra to provide a comprehensive and informative resource for anyone planning a trip to India. Our website features detailed information on popular tourist destinations, hidden gems, cultural attractions, festivals, accommodation options, transportation, and travel tips. We also have a blog with articles on a variety of topics related to India travel, such as planning your trip, packing for India, getting around, staying safe and healthy, cultural etiquette, and must-see sights and experiences. In addition to promoting tourism in India, Bharat Yatra is also a platform for us to boost our technical and social knowledge. We have learned a great deal about web design, development, and content creation through the process of creating and maintaining our website. We have also had the opportunity to connect with people from all over the world who are interested in traveling to India. We are excited to share our love of India with the world through Bharat Yatra. We hope that our website will inspire people to travel to India and experience its incredible beauty and culture for themselves.</p>
